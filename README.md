# drinksomething
- I use the table to implement DrinkSomething.

## Funtions
The entire function is as follows:
- First, you can enter a name, price and description.  Then, You can use image + to add an order.  
- Second, if you click on the pencil image, you can edit the row in the table.  When editing is complete, you can click the check mark image to save the edit.
- Third, you can click the arrow image to change the order of names or prices.  More specifically, the up arrow represents ASC.
- Finally, you can delete the order by clicking on the image "X".

## Notes
There are a few things to emphasize:
- When you enter a price, you can only enter a positive number or 0.  When the order is saved, the numbers will be converted to legal positive numbers.
- Also, you must enter a name and price, and if you do not enter a value, you will receive an alert.
